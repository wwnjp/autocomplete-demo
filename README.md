# autocomplete-demo## Josh Drumm â€” 29 Nov 2016This is a demo project that was intended to show the "beyond the basics" of JavaScript by making a working autocomplete input field. This is a single .js file that is self contained to set up all the events and DOM manipulation to create it.Features include:* Once the user types at least 3 characters, the user will see autocompleted prompts to finish their typing for them* AJAX-ability to fetch results from a 3rd party server (not fully implemented here)* Arrow key support to navigate and activate selected items.The code includes grunt tasks to handle building and compiling of all assets. The compiled location is in the dist/ directory included in this package. In order to use the grunt build system, you will need:* [node.js][http://nodejs.org] * [gruntjs][http://gruntjs.com]* [npm][http://npm.org]When all those are installed, you can build the tasks using:`grunt build`If you opt not to use these tools, you can directly edit the files in the dist/ directory and see your changes
